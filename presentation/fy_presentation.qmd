## Population ageing

- Population ageing:\
    *changes in the age structure of a population resulting in an increase in the proportion of older adults*

\newline

My research interest originates from three points:\ 

- Population ageing is a **challenge** and not a catastrophe
- Demographic intervention is a **futile endeavour**
- Population ageing is a **geographically diverse phenomenon**

- Population ageing is not equal across space
- On the regional level migration becomes a powerful driver
- More rural areas have progressed further in population ageing
:::

## Ageing and labour markets

- Labour markets are central to the economics of population ageing:
  - Workforces are ageing
  - Labour supply is decreasing
  - Yet older workers face many obstacles to continue working

- Old-age employment is mainly influenced by:
  - Health 
  - Gender 
  - Employment 
  - Retirement policies

- Regional demographics and labour markets are connected


::: {.notes}
Population Ageing Drivers:

- Operate on different scales.
- Imply diverse effects across geographic areas.
:::


## Research aims

- There is excessive emphasis on the extreme ends of both the age spectrum and the urban-rural continuum

\newline

My research aims are to:

- Integrate demographic and geographic perspective on population ageing and its relation to the labour market dynamics.
- Investigate the factors that contribute to spatial variations in the labour force participation of older workers


::: {.notes}
Who works? Where do they work? What type of work are doing? Why do they work?
:::


## Research Questions

Question 1:

- *What are the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of older workers and how do they differ across regions?*

Question 2:

- *What role does the composition and dynamics of local labour markets play in shaping labour force participation of older worker?*

::: {.notes}
- Establishing the ground work
- explore how it relates to regional economic dynamics
:::


## Research Questions

Question 3:

- *What is the impact of life course events on labour force participation and employment status during old age?*

Question 4: 

- *What are the migration patterns of older workers in the period leading up to their retirement, and how do these patterns influence their decisions regarding employment and retirement?*

::: {.notes}
- Life course approach, how do career trajectories/events influence old-age employment (with spatial considerations)
- Extension of part 3, zooming in on migration. often overlooked age group of migrants.

## Research design & Outlook

- Compilation thesis (four articles)
- Quantitative methods
- Using swedish register data
- Open for input on potential use of qualitative methods
