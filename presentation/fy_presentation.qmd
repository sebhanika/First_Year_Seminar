## Population ageing

- Population ageing:\
    *changes in the age structure of a population resulting an increase in the proportion of older adults*

\newline

My research interest originates from on three observations:\ 

- Population ageing is a **challenge** and not a catastrophe
- Demographic intervention is a **futile endeavour**
- Population ageing is a **geographically diverse phenomenon**

- Population ageing is not equal across space
- On the regional level migration becomes a powerful driver
- More rural areas have progressed further in population ageing

## Ageing and labour markets

- Labor markets are central


## Research aims

- Integrate demographic and geographic perspective on population ageing and its relation to the labour market dynamics.
- Investigate the factors that contribute to spatial variations in the labour force participation of older workers

::: {.notes}
My research is guided by addressing four very basic questions related to older workers: Who works? Where do they work? What type of work are doing? Why do they work?
:::


## Research Questions 1 & 2 

- What are the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of older workers and how do they differ across regions?
- What role does the composition and dynamics of local labour markets play in shaping labour force participation of older worker?

::: {.notes}
- Establishing the ground work
- explore how it relates to regional economic dynamics
:::


## Research Questions 3 & 4 

- What is the impact of life course events on labour force participation and employment status during old age?
- What are the migration patterns of older workers in the period leading up to their retirement, and how do these patterns influence their decisions regarding employment and retirement?

::: {.notes}
- Life course approach, how do career trajectories/events influence old-age employment (with spatial considerations)
- Extension of part 3, zooming in on migration. often overlooked age group of migrants.
