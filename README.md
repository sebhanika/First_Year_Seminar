# First Year Seminar

This repository contains the code and output for the visualizations for my first-year semianr as part of my PhD at the department of Human geography at Lund University. 
The visualizations show the drivers behind population in Sweden and selected European countries. 

The graphs can be found here [here](fy_viszs/graphs)
